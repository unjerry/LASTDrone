# physicsEngine branch
after reviewing the currently existing physics engine, including "box2D"
and "bullet3", I decided to make my own physics engine for the
"Breakout" game, for the existing complete physics engine are too big 
for me to fully understand it an use it.

also creating this branch doesn't mean I give up the branches including
"imgui" for ui, "assimp"(which is a library recommended by the 
LearnopenGl.com) for assets management and "box2D" "bullet3".
indeed i definitely need to integrate the "imgui" library in this branch 
to have a better user interface.
